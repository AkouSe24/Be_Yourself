Short Intro about me
Hello! I am Akouvi Selom Alex, a 35-year-old passionate and goal-oriented individual. From a young age, I understood the importance of education. Arriving in Germany in 1997, I quickly adapted to learning a new language, despite the unfamiliar environment. With the invaluable support of a woman I affectionately call "my angel", I successfully integrated into the German system. Her kindness and support helped me overcome the trauma I faced after my parents' absence in Togo.
Inspired by her guidance, I dedicated myself to my studies, pursuing my education with zeal and determination. I later worked as an assistant nurse, gaining valuable experience with people. An opportunity where my characters were defined and built up.
After the birth of my first son, I realized the need for a career change and enrolled in the ReDi School of Digital Integration. There, I discovered my interest in technology and digitalization. So I learned essential skills such as CV writing, making a ppt presentation, using google in its various forms, cyberbullying, etc. This marked the beginning of my journey into the IT fields.
